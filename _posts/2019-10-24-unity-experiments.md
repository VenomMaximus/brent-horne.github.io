#### My Beginnings in Game Development

Some of my first experiments I did within Unity for class in Full Sail University involved creating simple scenes and having certain components, such as audio players and teleporters, work within the simple terrain scenes I created.

Ultimately, we were tasked with creating a scene we would build ourselves using objects we created in Blender, and showcase what simple stuff we had learned. I decided to go above and beyond and actually import some models from the 3DS game Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies to create a rendition of the courthouse from the series, which I enjoy immensely.

I also added in a small button you could press on the keyboard that would make a music file play and the models would do a quick animation. Feel free to try out this little experiment below! I didn’t code in a “quit” function at the time, so to exit the game you need to press Alt+F4.
