## Tragedy of Lazou-Polis

![Tragedy Header](/assets/img/posts/post-2/post-header.jpg)

Early on in my degree we were tasked with experimenting with Unity, but we were also tasked with using the program Twine in order to create a “choose your own adventure” style of game. The assignment itself was fairly simple and involved just making a few branching paths and some fail-states and including a method to restart the game once the player had died.

However, I still wanted to push myself to do more than what was necessary, so I decided to take it all a bit further. I taught myself a bit of HTML in order to tinker a bit more with Twine than what was required, and as a result managed to create a simple “inventory” system that acted as a clue repository. The player would pick up on clues after questioning certain NPCs and then these clues would be stored within a notebook.

While my writing has certainly improved immensely since creating this simple game, I am still rather proud of the inventory system I had created for it. Feel free to try out the game for yourself below!
