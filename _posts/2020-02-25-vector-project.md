My final assignment for the class of February revolved around using vectors and raycasts in order to create a functioning game. These were very new concepts to me, and I had a bit of trouble with understanding them at first.

However, within a week, I quickly created a very short functioning “game” that used both vectors and raycasts in order to hold itself up. In order for the doors and pills to be properly interacted with, a raycast is shot out from the front of the “player”, which is a small box. This allows the player to, when in range, open the doors and swallow the pill they choose to swallow.

Despite being relatively simple as a game, I believe this project mainly shows that I can quickly understand and then utilize an entirely new concept taught to me, which I did rather effectively here.
