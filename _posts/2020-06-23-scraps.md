One of the larger assignments of my degree, “SCRAPS” was a project where we had to create a level for a pre-existing game. We had to follow the setting and aesthetic of the game that was already created, and quickly make a level that utilized a few mechanics the game already had. For SCRAPS, this was a small tool that could move around objects. It operated a lot like the Gravity Gun from *Half-Life 2*.

The level created by me in SCRAPS is seen as soon as the game says that the “Redmurk Power Plant” checkpoint has been activated. My level, a massive nuclear power plant, utilized simple puzzles using the gravity tool to open doors by placing crates on pressure pads. The player was set with retrieving the reactor core from Redmurk Power Plant, and to do so the player had to traverse through a multi-floor building I created entirely on my own.

While very rough around the edges and definitely in need of some more clutter to breathe life into it, the level I created for this project was one of the better ones I had seen, and I was ultimately rather proud of what I had constructed.
