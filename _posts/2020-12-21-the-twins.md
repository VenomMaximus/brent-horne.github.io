title: "The Twins"

This is an excerpt from a short story I had written in my free-time during my education. The genre is dark fantasy, and this is relatively early in the story overall. I chose to only show an excerpt here because it is the best way to concisely display what I am capable of.

Be warned that the contents are somewhat violent, as the excerpt details a short medieval battle in one segment.
