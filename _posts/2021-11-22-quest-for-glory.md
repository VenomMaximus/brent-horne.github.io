The final project of my degree involved recreating an existing game, and the team I had chosen for myself had picked “Quest for Glory” by Sierra as our reference game. It would involve months of work and ultimately act as the final test in order to earn my degree.

Early on within the project, I had tempered myself and my general ambitions so that I could focus on making sure the mechanics I created worked rather than were “flashy”, and the result was that most of my foundational early work was very solid and worked as a good springboard for the team to build off of. Later on in the project, I had decided to become slightly more ambitious, and later created the “Conversation” system, which is what a majority of the game’s “Look”, “Use Item”, “Talk”, and other systems are built upon.

After my graduation, I dedicated a bit more time to polish and putting in various assets created by myself so that the game could look better. Working on the project taught me a lot about teamwork, scheduling, QA, and gave me a very good sense of my own capabilities. It was an arduous and difficult project, to be sure, but I believe it came out very well considering my anxiety about my skills at the time.

There are many remnant bugs, and the sheer amount of them had really shown me the importance of thorough QA testing.

Regardless, feel free to click the link below to download the game and try it out for yourself!
