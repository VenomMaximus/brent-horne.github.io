title: "Untold Soul Tabletop Excerpts"
---

**Untold Soul**, my largest project yet, began as a tabletop game run by myself for some of my friends. I believe that some of my writing done for the tabletop is a very good representation of my writing capability, especially in the moment as a large portion of the writing had to be done on the spot without any proofreading.

As a tabletop campaign, Untold Soul uses the Fate Condensed ruleset, and has been run regularly in a "play-by-post" format in some times, weekly sessions in other times.

Below is a collection of excerpts from the tabletop campaign.
