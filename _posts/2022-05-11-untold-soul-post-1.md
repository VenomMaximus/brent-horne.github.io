### "Now that we are at the end of everything, where do you stand?"

Here is the first development post for an in-development project of mine, *Untold Soul!* Untold Soul is currently being developed between myself and one of my friends from college, with my role being primarily in the design, writing, and management department and my friend taking the role of lead developer.

Untold Soul is a mystery / horror that takes heavy inspiration from games such as *Umineko no Naku Koro ni* and *Ace Attorney*, and from authors such as *Junji Ito* and *H.P. Lovecraft*. The game will be a mixture of point-and-click, with clues to collect and places to explore, and visual novel, with various dialogue choices and characters to speak to. This game is based on the tabletop campaign I have run of the same name, excerpts of which can be found [here](#).

Currently, the design document for the game has reached over *ten thousand words long!* It’s a monumental undertaking for me, but it is a project I am very passionate about and hope to see to completion. Currently, what is planned as a first release is a short (at most 3 hours) “prologue” arc that will accustom the player to the world and the game’s mechanics, and will also serve as a good way for me to accustom myself to some more serious game design. There are many plans in store regarding mechanics, including a journal for clues, dialogue choices, investigating locations, etc.

So far, a lot of the early work has been focused with completing the basic UI structure and the text itself, with a basic “typewriter” function having been very recently completed. All of the art assets are currently placeholder material that has been taken from the PS3 version of *Umineko no Naku Koro ni*, and will be replaced in due time with completely original assets created by a commissioned artist. Still, I have to admit that for me there is a bit of humor in attaching these various Umineko characters to my own story.

Regardless, I have been writing endlessly for the script for the past two weeks, and there isn’t much sign of me stopping. I’ll be keeping this blog updated with progress on me and my teammate’s work, and hopefully there will be some more interesting things to show off soon!
