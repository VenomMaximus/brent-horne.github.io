### "The opposing duelist's hands quiver. His trigger finger continues to twitch as doubt filled his mind."

Here is the second development post for the in-development project *Untold Soul!*

A lot of work has been done regarding more of the dialogue mechanics of the game, along with even further writing of the game’s dialogue, characters, and plot. The “team” (still myself and a friend) are hard at work with trying to get the base systems in place so that a working prototype can soon be posted! Furthermore, an artist is currently hard at work with making sprites, backgrounds, and other elements for the game in order to truly give it the aesthetic that it needs.

Remember the design document from before? It has practically doubled in size within the last month, with a wealth of dialogue, notes, character descriptions, mechanics, and more detailed in a meticulous fashion. The introduction segment of the game has seen extensive revision and is now at a state that I personally find acceptable, and even more scenes have been written that will constitute the various acts of the game.

My writing style tends to be a little haphazard when it comes to organization, with my focus being on disparate scenes, dialogue sequences, etc and writing them in non-chronological order as they come to me. Afterwards, the scenes are then pieced together into an acceptable chronology and given appropriate transitions between one another. The result is that a *lot* of dramatic scenes and dialogue segments have been made in rather rapid succession. I like to write in this fashion because it allows me to think, “What would be a riveting scene for the player to see?”, and then I create that scene. I think of how the player *approaches* this scene later.

It’s almost like taking a bunch of random, cool photos of things you see over the course of a month and then choosing how you will arrange those photos later.

But, enough about my writing methods! On to the actual gameplay progress!

In this video, you will be able to see some of the latest work that’s been done for the game in terms of gameplay mechanics and systems design. The “Inventory” and “Journal” systems are not quite ready yet… but they are getting there, and will be shown off in the next development post!

What can be shown off properly is the newly added “Question” or “Choice” system. This system allows for characters to ask the player questions or for the game to prompt the player with particular choices. These choices will then proceed to lead down towards different routes within the game, resulting in a very replayable experience and allowing the player’s to tailor some of the protagonist’s temperament to suit their interests.

Furthermore, a few more new details for the text has been added. Namely, a blinker to show when dialogue has “finished” and the player can safely click continue, as well as a “chirp” sound effect for the shifting text. This chirp is currently placeholder, but will eventually be utilized to give all the different characters a particular “voice” via the chirp, due to the present lack of voice actors (which will likely persist, considering the low budget of the game). The chirp sound itself is subject to changing, as I’m still not entirely pleased with it, but the system itself is working quite perfectly.

Well, that is all for now! Next month, I’m sure that I’ll be able to go over the finished “Journal” system, and perhaps even show off some new art assets that have been made for the game!
