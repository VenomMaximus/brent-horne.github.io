# About

Welcome to my website! Iâ€™m Brent Horne, an aspiring game designer and writer who has worked on many different projects both in my free time and during my education in university.

I have a deep level of admiration for the design process, as well as the intricacies that go into planning and management. As a result, I always like to have a great deal of attention to detail for any project I start. This becomes readily apparent within lengthy design documents and thorough issue tracking.

A lot of the projects I have worked on are available for viewing within my [Blog](#), with my favorites displayed on the main page of this site.

Feel free to contact me for any work opportunities or questions about my current projects.
