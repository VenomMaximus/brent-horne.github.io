title: 'Untold Soul'
---
**Untold Soul** is an in-progress adventure/puzzle game developed by myself and two of my close friends. Set during the early 20th century, Untold Soul focuses on a world-reaching conspiracy of secret societies, strange rituals, and esoteric magic in a world that rapidly technologically progressing.
Developed within the Unity Engine from the ground-up and seeking to give a player a compelling mystery both narratively and mechanically, Untold Soul takes a great deal of inspiration from titles such as Ace Attorney, Umineko no Naku Koro ni, and the Rusty Lake franchise. Set to be a mixture of point-and-click adventure and visual novel, Untold Soul is my first big project post-graduation, and is being continuously worked on throughout my free-time.

A working demo of the game is still being worked on, and will be uploaded to here as soon as it is ready. Stay tuned!

Development posts can be found in the [Blog](https://venommaximus.github.io/blog) section of my site.

Below is a link to the post that holds all of the various excerpts from the tabletop campaign that inspired the game.
