title: 'Untold Soul'
---
[Untold Soul] is an in-progress adventure/puzzle game developed by myself and two of my close friends. Set during the early 20th century, Untold Soul focuses on a world-reaching conspiracy of secret societies, strange rituals, and esoteric magic in a world that rapidly technologically progressing.
Developed within the Unity Engine from the ground-up and seeking to give a player a compelling mystery both narratively and mechanically, Untold Soul takes a great deal of inspiration from titles such as Ace Attorney, Umineko no Naku Koro ni, and the Rusty Lake franchise. Set to be a mixture of point-and-click adventure and visual novel, Untold Soul is my first big project post-graduation, and is being continuously worked on throughout my free-time.
Development posts can be found in the [Blog] (#) section of my site. Below is a demo of the opening scene.
