title: 'KaiserreduX - German Rework'
---

The **German Rework** for [KaiserreduX](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2076426030) is a volunteer modding project I have done for the past year for the video game [Hearts of Iron IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/). KaiserreduX is an alternative history total conversion mod that is developed by dozens of different people, and I have been the main individual spearheading the creation of the German Rework. The German Rework involves new playable content for the German Empire, a "major" country of the game, and alongside it new mechanics and features.

I have been responsible for design, scripting, writing, and collaborating with another developer via GitHub throughout the German Rework's development. I have additionally had to research the involved individuals, since Hearts of Iron IV is a game that utilizes real-life persons of history. One of my core motivations for the project has mostly been to provide a fun experience for players and to design something I would enjoy playing myself, and a key part of that has been providing numerous different routes for the player to undertake.

One of the core parts of the project I am the most proud of is the economy section. Here, I designed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with an artist in order to provide the player with more means of investing within their economic sphere. I did this to try and illustrate the feeling of playing as an economic heavyweight and to offer more ways for the player to interact with their allies, giving more mechanical use to maintaining friendly relations with other powers.

Below is a link to a Google Drive folder full of "teaser" images that are designed to show snippets of my work, which have been put out to the public. They showcase a small part of what I have been able to make. Feel free to contact me directly for more information.
