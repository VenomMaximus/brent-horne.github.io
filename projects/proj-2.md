title: 'Quest for Glory'
---

**Quest for Glory** is my final project that I built within a team of 4 at the end of my education in Full Sail University. Despite various troubles in the form of teammates leaving or dropping out due to faltering grades, the short game ultimately saw completion, with me seeing it through from start to finish.

Working exclusively on the dialogue system, quests, puzzles, and various aspects of the inventory, I had to track a lot of my work within Jira and Confluence, and properly plan out what could come next for the project within those tools. 

Unfortunately, the game possesses many remnant bugs from the features added on at the tail end of the development cycle, but is still overall playable, and features that are wholly my own (dialogue, inventory, puzzle system, and characters being the biggest examples) work very well.
