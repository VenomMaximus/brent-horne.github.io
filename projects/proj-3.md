title: 'Tanya's Concert'
---

**Tanya's Concert** is an in-progress adventure game built within RPG Maker MZ. Currently, the game uses plenty of placeholder assets from the game *Umineko no Naku Koro ni*, specifically the two PS3 remakes produced by Alchemist in 2010 and 2011.

Tanya's Concert is my first attempt at using RPG Maker to create a game, and I am quickly teaching myself various different aspects of it while also working on Untold Soul. Tanya's Concert is set to be a project that can display my own solo skills as a designer, as it is being produced entirely by myself barring all art assets.
